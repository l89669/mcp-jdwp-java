/**
 * Central registry for breakpoints owned by the MCP server and a parking spot for the last thread
 * that hit a suspending event. JDI's `BreakpointRequest` has no user-facing identifier, so this
 * service mints synthetic monotonic integer IDs and exposes them to the MCP client.
 * <p>
 * Maintains six parallel state maps:
 * - `breakpointsById` — line breakpoints already bound to a JDI `BreakpointRequest`.
 * - `pendingBreakpointsById` — line breakpoints whose target class is not yet loaded.
 * - `exceptionBreakpointsById` — exception breakpoints bound to a JDI `ExceptionRequest`.
 * - `pendingExceptionBreakpointsById` — exception breakpoints whose exception class is not yet loaded.
 * - `fieldBreakpointsById` — field watchpoints already bound to JDI `WatchpointRequest`(s) —
 *   `BOTH`-mode binds two requests (one access, one modification) under one synthetic ID.
 * - `pendingFieldBreakpointsById` — field watchpoints whose declaring class is not yet loaded.
 * <p>
 * Pending entries are promoted to active either by `JdiEventListener.handleClassPrepareEvent` (the
 * normal path) or by the {@link #tryPromotePending} safety net (called from {@link JDIConnectionService#getVM()}
 * before every tool call) for classes loaded before any debugger event was delivered.
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: all public mutators are `synchronized`; the read-mostly state maps are
 * `ConcurrentHashMap` so listeners can iterate without contending with mutators. The `lastBreakpoint*`
 * fields are `volatile` for cross-thread visibility from the JDI listener thread to MCP worker threads.
