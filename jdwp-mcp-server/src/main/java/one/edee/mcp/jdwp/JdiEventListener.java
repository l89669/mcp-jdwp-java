/**
 * Drains the JDI event queue on a dedicated daemon thread named `jdi-event-listener`. The MCP
 * server MUST consume every event the target VM emits — JDI blocks the target on a full event
 * queue, so this listener has to keep up.
 * <p>
 * Per-event behaviour (every suspending handler follows the order
 * snapshot → history → latch so a concurrent reader observing the {@link EventHistory} tail
 * never sees it ahead of {@link BreakpointTracker#getLastBreakpoint()}):
 * - `BreakpointEvent` → publish snapshot via {@link BreakpointTracker#setLastBreakpointThread},
 * record to {@link EventHistory}, fire the resume-until-event latch, and KEEP the thread suspended
 * (auto-resume only for logpoints and false conditional breakpoints).
 * - `StepEvent` → delete the one-shot StepRequest (JDI requirement), tag the snapshot via
 * {@link BreakpointTracker#setLastSuspendingEvent} with {@link BreakpointTracker.EventKind#STEP}
 * (the STEP snapshot inherits the prior BP id so watcher fallbacks still resolve), record, fire.
 * - `ExceptionEvent` → tag the snapshot via {@link BreakpointTracker#setLastSuspendingEvent} with
 * {@link BreakpointTracker.EventKind#EXCEPTION} (id null), record throw/catch metadata, fire.
 * - `ClassPrepareEvent` → promote pending line and exception breakpoints for the loaded class.
 * - `VMStartEvent` → keep the VM suspended so the user can finish wiring up breakpoints.
 * - `VMDisconnectEvent` / `VMDeathEvent` → record `VM_DEATH`, fire the resume-until-event latch so
 * any parked `jdwp_resume_until_event` caller detects the dead VM promptly, then invoke the optional
 * {@link #vmDeathHook} before exiting the loop. A {@code VMDisconnectedException} raised by the JDI
 * event queue follows the same contract — abrupt target exit is handled symmetrically to a graceful
 * death event.
 * <p>
 * Promotion contract: the main listener loop does not call
 * {@link BreakpointTracker#tryPromotePending(JDIConnectionService)} directly — promotion happens
 * lazily via {@link JDIConnectionService#getVM()} on the next MCP tool call. Logpoint and
 * conditional-BP handlers DO end up calling it indirectly the first time after connect (via
 * {@code configureCompilerClasspath} → {@code discoverClasspath} → {@code getVM}); the safety-net
 * promoter is strictly passive (it never calls {@code invokeMethod} on the target VM), so it is
 * safe to invoke from any event-thread context.
 * <p>
 * Chain handling: after every BP, exception, or auto-resumed logpoint hit,
 * {@link #applyChainEffectsAfterHit} arms any dependent BPs waiting on the firing BP and
 * re-disarms one-shot dependents — the firing event itself is unchanged; chain side-effects
 * are an additive concern.
