/**
 * Drains the JDI event queue on a dedicated daemon thread named `jdi-event-listener`. The MCP
 * server MUST consume every event the target VM emits — JDI blocks the target on a full event
 * queue, so this listener has to keep up.
 * <p>
 * Per-event behaviour:
 * - `BreakpointEvent` → record to {@link EventHistory}, update {@link BreakpointTracker#setLastBreakpointThread},
 * fire the resume-until-event latch, and KEEP the thread suspended (auto-resume only for logpoints
 * and false conditional breakpoints).
 * - `StepEvent` → delete the one-shot StepRequest (JDI requirement), record, fire the latch.
 * - `ExceptionEvent` → record with throw/catch metadata, set `lastBreakpointThread` with sentinel
 * BP id `-1`, fire the latch.
 * - `ClassPrepareEvent` → promote pending line and exception breakpoints for the loaded class.
 * - `VMStartEvent` → keep the VM suspended so the user can finish wiring up breakpoints.
 * - `VMDisconnectEvent` / `VMDeathEvent` → record `VM_DEATH`, fire the resume-until-event latch so
 * any parked `jdwp_resume_until_event` caller detects the dead VM promptly, then invoke the optional
 * {@link #vmDeathHook} before exiting the loop. A {@code VMDisconnectedException} raised by the JDI
 * event queue follows the same contract — abrupt target exit is handled symmetrically to a graceful
 * death event.
 * <p>
 * Promotion contract: the main listener loop does not call
 * {@link BreakpointTracker#tryPromotePending(JDIConnectionService, ThreadReference)} directly —
 * promotion happens lazily via {@link JDIConnectionService#getVM()} on the next MCP tool call.
 * Logpoint and conditional-BP handlers DO end up calling it indirectly the first time after
 * connect (via {@code configureCompilerClasspath} → {@code discoverClasspath} → {@code getVM}),
 * which is safe because the BP thread is already suspended at a method-invocation event —
 * JDI permits {@code invokeMethod} on threads in that state.
 * <p>
 * Chain handling: after every BP, exception, or auto-resumed logpoint hit,
 * {@link #applyChainEffectsAfterHit} arms any dependent BPs waiting on the firing BP and
 * re-disarms one-shot dependents — the firing event itself is unchanged; chain side-effects
 * are an additive concern.
