/**
 * Bounded ring buffer of debug events for post-mortem inspection via the `jdwp_get_events` tool.
 * Most events originate from the JDI event queue drained by {@link JdiEventListener}, but it is NOT
 * the sole producer: synchronous install-time diagnostics are recorded from MCP worker threads too
 * (e.g. {@code BP_MULTI_LOCATION} from {@link JDWPTools}, {@code RECONNECT} from
 * {@link JDIConnectionService}).
 * <p>
 * Behaviour:
 * - FIFO ring buffer with a fixed cap of {@link #MAX_EVENTS} entries; oldest entries are dropped first.
 * - Thread-safe via {@link ConcurrentLinkedDeque}: the listener thread and the MCP worker threads may
 * record concurrently, and concurrent readers never block writers. Because there are multiple
 * producers, no global ordering is guaranteed beyond each individual {@code record} call.
 * - Cleared on `jdwp_reset`, `jdwp_clear_events`, and {@link JDIConnectionService#cleanupSessionState}.
 * <p>
 * Documented event type strings (exhaustive for production code — keep in sync; tests may record
 * ad-hoc types that are intentionally not listed here): `BREAKPOINT`, `BREAKPOINT_SUPPRESSED`, `STEP`, `STEP_SUPPRESSED`,
 * `EXCEPTION`, `EXCEPTION_SUPPRESSED`, `EXCEPTION_LOG`, `EXCEPTION_LOG_ERROR`, `LOGPOINT`,
 * `LOGPOINT_ERROR`, `FIELD_ACCESS`, `FIELD_MODIFICATION`, `FIELD_BREAKPOINT_SUPPRESSED`,
 * `FIELD_LOGPOINT`, `FIELD_LOGPOINT_ERROR`, `CHAIN_ARMED`, `CHAIN_DISARMED`, `CHAIN_BROKEN`,
 * `CLASS_PREPARE`, `BP_MULTI_LOCATION`, `BP_PROMOTION_FAILED`, `RECONNECT`, `VM_START`, `VM_DEATH`.
 * These are the keys clients can grep on or filter by.
